# Credit-Risk-Models-PD-LGD-EAD-Expected-Loss

**We calculate PD,LGD,EAD and Expected loss using logistic and beta regressions.** 
Notebook 1: Training dataset preparation (Feature engineering - Continuous and Discrete dataset)<br/>
Notebook 2: Test dataset preparation
Notebook 3: Calculate Probability of Default (POD) and Credit score card preparation
Notebook 4: Monitor the POD model 
Notebook 5: Calculate LGD (Loss given dataset) and EAD (Exposure at Default)for individual customers
Notebook 6: Compute Expected Loss for individual customers
